# Movie-Sentimental-Analysis-
This project is for predicting movie sentiments based on user review comment. Deep learning Recurrent Neural Networ model was built to perform prediction.  

In this project , we will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. We will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, we will deploy our model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
